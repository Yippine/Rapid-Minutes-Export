        Weekly Development Team Meeting
        Date: January 15, 2024
        Time: 10:00 AM - 11:00 AM
        Location: Conference Room A / Zoom
        
        Attendees:
        - John Smith (Engineering Manager) - Present
        - Sarah Johnson (Senior Developer) - Present  
        - Mike Chen (QA Engineer) - Present
        - Lisa Wong (Product Manager) - Remote
        
        Meeting opened at 10:05 AM by John Smith.
        
        Agenda Item 1: Sprint Review
        Sarah presented the completed features from Sprint 23. All planned items were delivered on time. 
        The new authentication system is working well with 99.9% uptime.
        
        Agenda Item 2: Bug Report Analysis  
        Mike reported 15 bugs found during testing. 8 are critical and need immediate attention.
        Discussion on root cause analysis showed need for better unit test coverage.
        
        Agenda Item 3: Next Sprint Planning
        Lisa outlined the priorities for Sprint 24. Focus will be on performance optimization and mobile responsiveness.
        Team capacity: 40 story points based on velocity.
        
        Action Items:
        1. Sarah to fix the 8 critical bugs by Wednesday, January 17th
        2. Mike to update test automation scripts by Friday, January 19th  
        3. John to schedule performance testing session with DevOps team
        4. Lisa to finalize Sprint 24 requirements and update Jira by Tuesday
        
        Decisions Made:
        1. Approved budget increase of $15,000 for performance monitoring tools
        2. Agreed to extend Sprint 24 to 3 weeks instead of 2 due to complexity
        3. Decided to hire additional QA engineer for mobile testing
        
        Key Outcomes:
        - Sprint 23 completed successfully with all deliverables
        - Critical bug remediation plan established
        - Sprint 24 scope and timeline finalized
        - Budget approval for performance improvements
        
        Next Meeting: January 22, 2024 at 10:00 AM
        Meeting adjourned at 10:55 AM.
